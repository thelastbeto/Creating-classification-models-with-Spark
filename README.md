Creating classification models with Spark using MLlib

  We have received a request to assist the marketing team in predicting whether a customer will cancel the service, as they are observing an issue with churn.
  Our proposal for this problem is to create a machine learning model capable of classifying customers into those who will cancel the service and those who will not.
  To achieve this, we will use a dataset provided by the marketing team containing information about the customer, such as the type of service they have contracted, how long their contract has been active, etc. With this information, we will build the model.
  We will use PySpark for this task, primarily leveraging Spark DataFrame SQL and MLlib. Using this tool, we will handle the entire machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, model fitting through algorithms, optimization of these models by finding the best hyperparameters, and finally, model validat
